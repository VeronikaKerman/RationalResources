// Opt-In system for RR Cyromats (freezers/heaters)

// Serial converting capacity (RRPower) is the default rating of a converter

// Parallel converting capacity (RRSlots) is the core count, used by mods that
// enable (or force) converters to have slots and switchable modules. These
// mods include Kerbalism.

// The actual processing patches are applied by Apply_Cryomats config files.
// To opt-in, other mods may include RR* fields in their part or patch configs.
